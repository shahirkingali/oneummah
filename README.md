Ummah is an Arabic word meaning "community".

Ummah - Find online communities on Slack, Discord, Twitch, Telegram, Facbook and other platforms.
The platform is a digital community finder for niche-focused groups. A search directory for any online-community.

As we live in a socially distanced society now it's hard to find like-minded individuals to converse on interesting topics. It is very difficult to engage in any discussion. We are all spending our days at home, or socially distanced from one another. The new normalcy is to be online. 

I wanted to help those individuals that want to still have the feeling of community by being able to, simply search for a community and join, rather than opening up multiple tabs for multiple platforms. 

Another feature of the platform that will be added later than the road is enabling geo-fencing to locate different digital communities that are sourced locally. For example, if a college student in the East Bay whose passions are designing, they can search for a specific search or broader search and find local-digital communities that maybe be close by.

On the platform, you can search for communities, or browse through different niches on the communities page. You can also sign-into your account and see a dashboard if you are a community leader. Furthermore, you can also submit a community-platform that isnâ€™t listed on the platform.

This project is still in development phase, and work in progress. I had designed the user interface using Adobe XD and then translated my design files into code. There are some components missing but will be added in the near future. 

The logo and other design components were done by me and also used design resources from: flaticon.com, thenounproject.com, freepik.com, and vecteezy.com
